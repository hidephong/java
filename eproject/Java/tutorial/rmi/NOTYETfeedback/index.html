  <LI>Date: 16 Jan 1999<BR>
<P>I am currently working on a problem involving RMI. I am faced 
with a problem that whenever the network load is high, some kind of 
timeout occurs and 'NoRouteToHost' exception is thrown. I want to change 
the settings in RMI so that this timeout period is increased.<P>
  <LI>Date: 30 Mar 1999<BR>
<P>
Over the past few weeks I've spent quite a bit of time in the RMI
trail of the Java Tutorial (March 12, 1999 edition) and I feel there
are some very serious problems that should be addressed.
<P>
I sincerely don't mean to sound critical in this e-mail -- overall I
think the Java Tutorial is a terrific piece of work -- but the RMI
trail needs some fixing up (IMHO).  If you'd like to speak with me
about any of these issues, you can reach me at: W:(602) 607-4995 or
H:(602) 813-4452.
<P>
I'm sorry about the length of this message but I've tried to be
complete and clear.
<P>
First, I'd like to direct your attention to the section entitled,
"Build a JAR File of Interface Classes", at "/rmi/compiling.html".
The second-to-last paragraph in that section begins with this
statement:
<P>
   "When you build either server- or client-side classes
    with the javac and rmic compilers, you generally need
    to specify where the resulting class files should
    reside so that they are network accessible."
<P>
I believe this is a minor wording problem.  Although it is necessary
to specify a "network-accessible" location of class files before the
client and server begin execution so that classes may be downloaded
dynamically, it is *not* necessary to specify their network-accessible
location at *build* time, as the statement above implies.  I believe
the statement above should read:
<P>
   "After you build either the server- or client-side
    classes with the javac and rmic compilers, you
    will need to ensure the resulting class files
    are placed in a network accessible location."
<P>
The same paragraph also seems to indicate that it is entirely possible
to use a "file:" URL when specifying where classes reside.  Now, I'm
not sure if the reference to the "file:" URL pertains to the location
of class files at compile-time or runtime.  I assume it refers to
making the class files network-accessible at runtime.  In other words,
I interpret the reference to the "file:" URL to mean that classes can
be made network-accessible using the "file:" URL rather than an
"HTTP:" URL.  Is this correct? I'll have more to say about this below.
<P>
The last paragraph in the same section makes reference to the use of
an HTTP server to download classes.  It does not, however, indicate
that an HTTP server is an absolute requirement for downloading
classes.  In fact, the Tutorial says, "RMI uses URL protocols
supported by the Java platform..."  I assume this includes the "file:"
URL.  In other words, my impression is that an HTTP server *can* be
used but so long as a network connection is available, HTTP is not
absolutely required.  On the other hand, the Tutorial makes reference to
a "simple HTTP server"
(ftp://java.sun.com/pub/jdk1.1/rmi/class-server.zip).  Does this mean
HTTP *is* required?  I recently posted this question to a few Java
newsgroups, as well as the JDC, and some of the responses I received
indicated that an HTTP server *MUST* be running on the machine from
which classes will be downloaded.  If this is so, the Java Tutorial
should say so explicitly.  If this is not the case, then it would be
extremely helpful if the Tutorial provided a working example using the
"file:" URL between two separate machines.
<P>
I'd also like to direct your attention to the section entitled, "A
Note about Security" on "rmi/running.html".  I think it would be very
helpful if the relationship between a "Permissions Policy" file and the
use of the RMISecurityManager was described.  What does the
RMISecurityManager provide that the "Permissions Policy" file doesn't
and vice versa?  Do I need both the RMISecurityManager *and* a
"Permissions Policy" file?
<P>
The next section, entitled, "Start the Server", begins with this
statement:
<P>
   "If you *do* start the rmiregistry and it *can* find your
    stub classes in CLASSPATH, it will not remember that
    the loaded stub class can be loaded from your server's
    code base, ..."
<P>
Personally, I find this entire paragraph a bit confusing.  I believe
that somehow the notion of annotating a class is involved here but I
really don't have a feel for it's relevance and the Tutorial does not
even mention class annotation.  I'd like to see a discussion on how
class annotation is related to the java.rmi.server.codebase property and
also a description of where the java.rmi.server.RMIClassLoader fits into
the picture.  What's the result if the java.rmi.server.codebase property
is *not* set?  When will the RMIClassLoader be used and when will it not
be used?
<P>
Ealier, I mentioned that it seemed to be possible (according to the
Tutorial) to use a "file:" URL to dynamically load classes across the
network.  Again, in the "Start the Server" section of the Tutorial is an
example that specifies a "file:" URL for the java.rmi.server.codebase
property:
<P>
java -Djava.rmi.server.codebase=file:/c:\home\ann\public_html\classes/
     -Djava.rmi.server.hostname=zaphod.east.sun.com
     -Djava.security.policy=java.policy
       engine.ComputeEngine
<P>
Once again, I'm assumming this means it is *not* necessary to have any
form of HTTP server running.  Is this correct?<P>
