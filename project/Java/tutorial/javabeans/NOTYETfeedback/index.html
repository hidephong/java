  <LI><P>At 
 , near the bottom of the page, it says:
<P>"The ChangeReporter Bean need not implement the PropertyChangeListener
interface; instead, the BeanBox generated adapter class implements
PropertyChangeListener, and the adapter's propertyChange method calls
the appropriate method in the target object (ChangeReporter)."

<P>The explanation for this is not given on this page, but on another page.
Nevertheless, it definitely should be explained on this page too, even
if briefly, because people are going to start wondering why this works.

  <LI><P>At 
 
<P>There is no OurListBox class!!! It must have been removed in the
recent release.

<P>Previous point notwithstanding, I still have no idea what an indexed
property is after reading this lesson as well as the specification.
While there is an example, there is no context for the example, which
makes it useless. In my opinion, this lesson has to be rewritten from
scratch.

  <P>priority (1-5): 4<P>
  <LI><P>At 
 ,in the section "Hooking Up Events in the BeanBox", it says that in the
Juggler's EventTargetDialog,

<P>"This list contains Juggler methods that take no arguments, or arguments
of type actionPerformed."

<P>"actionPerformed" should really be "ActionEvent".

  <P>priority (1-5): 4<P>
  <LI><P>At 
  in the section "Property Editors", it says that
<P>"To support the custom property editor, you need to override two more
methods: Override supportsCustomEditor to return true, and override
getCustomEditor to return a custom editor instance.
ColorEditor.getCustomEditor returns this."

<P>Not to be too picky, but I think we want "implement" rather than
"override", since PropertyEditor is an interface.
  <P>priority (1-5): 4<P>
  <LI><P>In the section "How Property Editors are Associated with Properties",
it says that

<P>"Property editors are discovered and associated with a given property by
... [e]xplicit association via a BeanInfo object. The Molecule demo Bean
uses this technique. Within the MoleculeBeanInfo class, the Molecule
Bean's property editor is set with the following line of code: 

<P>        pd.setPropertyEditorClass(MoleculeNameEditor.class);"

<P>Two things:

<P>1) We are setting the property editor for the Molecule Bean's
"MoleculeName" property, not the MoleculeBean itself.
<P>2) What is "pd"? When you look at the code, it's a property descriptor.
We should include the code that defines "pd" so that people know what is
going on.
  <P>priority (1-5): 4<P>

  <LI><P>In the section "The BDK Property Editors", there is a reference to
beans/apis/sun/beans/editors, which doesn't exist.
  <P>priority (1-5): 4<P>
  <LI><P>In the section "BDK Customizers", there is a reference to
OurButtonCustomizer, which seems to have been replaced by
ExplicitButtonCustomizer in the latest BDK.
  <P>priority (1-5): 4<P>
  <LI><P>Also, there is the snippet:


public BeanDescriptor getBeanDescriptor() {
        return new BeanDescriptor(beanClass, customizerClass);
}
...
private final static Class customizerClass =
        OurButtonCustomizer.class;


<P>We should add the line that defines beanClass.
