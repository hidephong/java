 the following statement needs to be clarified:

<P>"The arrays returned by the Collection-views' toArray operations
contains the keys, values, or entries in order."

<P>The keys and entries are sorted by key, as expected, but so are the
values. That is, the values are not ordered by value, but according to
the keys to which they're matched. The above statement seems to indicate
that the values array returned will be ordered by value.

<P>This has been brought to Josh's attention.

  I'm still having problems understanding this:
<P>"[SortedMap provides a constructor] that takes a SortedMap and returns a
new SortedMap containing the same mappings as the given SortedMap, and
sorted according to the same Comparator (or using the elements' natural
ordering, if the specified SortedMap did too). Note that it is the
compile-time type of the argument that determines whether this
constructor is invoked in preference to the ordinary Map constructor,
and not its runtime type!"
<P>

<P>This has been brought to Josh's attention.

  <LI><P>A user noted that the following sentence at 
  is misleading.
<P>"The fact that the new implementations are unsynchronized represents a
break with the past: Vector and Hashtable were synchronized in versions
of the JDK prior to 1.2."

<P>This sentence seems to indicate that Vector and Hashtable are no longer synchronized.

<P>This has been brought to Josh's attention.
